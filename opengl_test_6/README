This sample shows a curve with texture on fixed-function pipeline.

You can define the angle of z Coordinate by modify the Z_ANGLE in OpenGLView.m
You can define the number of face by modify the CURVE_FACE_NUM int OpenGLView.m

NOTICE:
Don't open the @selector(printf:) in OpenGLView.m when rotate, it's waste the CPU.
